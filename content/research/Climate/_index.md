## Sea surface temperature memory timescale
The satellite observation has shown that the sea surface temperature (SST) memory timescale has been elongated, which means that now it takes longer time for anomalously warm SST to decay.
Please refer to this [page](/research/Climate/tau_SST) for this study.

## Irreversible Fire Danger under Carbon Reduction
Climate change can enhance fire activity, which, in turn, accelerates climate change by releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These processes are studied through climate simulations.
Please refer to this [page](/research/Climate/FWI) for this study.
