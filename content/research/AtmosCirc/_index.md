## Idian Ocean Dipole

### Key Points
- Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)'s Rossby wave train is partially similar to the climatology; a negative IOD enormously increases zonal wavenumber 3
- IOD (El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation) is negatively (positively) correlated with zonal wavenumber 2 and 3 (1) in austral spring
- The extremely positive IOD in 2019 exhibited more significant increases and unusual changes in wave patterns
