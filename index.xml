      <description>Air-sea interactions We are investigating air-sea couplings to understand the climate system in both large- and meso-scale processes. For the research, we are using a coupled atmosphere-ocean model with biogeochemical module and explore the physical processes and their impact on biogeochemical processes including the carbon cycle.
Air-sea CO2 exchange While investigating the role of mesoscale eddies using both observations and numerical models, we find quite complicated, yet very interesting impacts of eddies in the Southern Ocean.</description>

      <description>Southern Ocean The Southern Ocean is unique. Consistent eastward wind results in upwelling of the water from the interior of the ocean, providing a passage for the exchange between the atmosphere and deep ocean. Unlike other major ocean basins, it does not have boundaries so that water circulates all around Antarctica. This wind-driven current is called Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and flows eastward connecting Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. The Southern Ocean plays an important role in earth&amp;rsquo;s climate.</description>

      <description>California Current System The California Current System is located at the east of the north Pacific. Equatorward upwelling favorable wind draws nutrient-rich water from the interior to the surface making ocean very productive. In fact, approximately 35% of wild-caught fish come from here (Kudela et al., 2009). I investigated the interaction between wind, upwelling and marine ecosystem using ocean circulation model.
Upwelling source waters Along the California coast, equatorward wind transports water to offshore, creating divergence and upwelling at the coast.</description>

      <description>Hajoon Song visited MIT from February 6th to February 20th, 2019, as a visiting professor. As in last summer, he collaborated with Professor John Marshall and Dr. MaryamRashed Alshehhi to understand the ocean circulation in the area of Arabian Gulf.
Using the state-of-art ocean circulation model, we tried to explain the salinity maximum in the subsurface of Arabian Sea observed in situ measurements and autonomous floats, Argo.
He was told that this winter has been mild until a very cold air mass covered the area one week before he visited.</description>

      <description>Hajoon Song visited MIT from July 1st to August 24th, 2018, as a visiting professor. During the stay, he contributes to the project of the simulation of the Gulf of Arabia using a very high-resolution numerical ocean model with Professor John Marshall and Dr. MaryamRashed Alshehhi. His role involved the launch of the ocean model, analyze and diagnose the model results, and visualize the simulation. Another project he was involved with was the diagnosing the simulation of Arctic with the interest of the heat transport from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arctic.</description>

      <description>The Southern Ocean leaving the footprints on the chlorophyll Jiwoo Choi 
Phytoplankton in the ocean contains chlorophyll in their body which absorbs CO2 and emits O2 during photosynthesis. Thus the amount of chlorophyll plays an important role in air-sea CO2 flux. The growth of phytoplankton depends on mainly two factors, light, and nutrient (iron in the Southern Ocean) which phytoplankton takes up as its food. The light provided to phytoplankton is abundant in summer, deficient in winter.</description>

The light provided to phytoplankton is abundant in summer, deficient in winter. Besides that, the light for phytoplankton also depends on the vertical mixing of the ocean.</description>
