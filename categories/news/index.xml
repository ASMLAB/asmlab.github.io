      <description>대기-해양 모델링 연구실에서 대학원생 연구원 및 학부 연구원을 모집합니다. 
저희 연구실에서는 대기-해양 상호작용이 대기와 해양의 순환과 탄소교환에 미치는 영향에 대한 프로젝트를 수행하고 있습니다. 이 프로젝트에서 저희는 위성 및 무인관측값과 고해상도 수치모델을 이용하는 연구를 계획중이며, 함께 연구할 수 있는 연구원을 모집하고 있습니다.
 대학원생 연구원 대기-해양 접합모델을 이용하여 대기-해양 상호작용과 이와 밀접한 관련이 있는 현상, 그리고 탄소순 연구에 관심이 있어서 대학원 진학을 희망하는 분들을 찾습니다. 2020년 2학기부터 시작하실 수 있고, 그 전까지 이메일로 지원를 받습니다.</description>

      <description>Hajoon Song visited MIT from February 6th to February 20th, 2019, as a visiting professor. As in last summer, he collaborated with Professor John Marshall and Dr. MaryamRashed Alshehhi to understand the ocean circulation in the area of Arabian Gulf.
Using the state-of-art ocean circulation model, we tried to explain the salinity maximum in the subsurface of Arabian Sea observed in situ measurements and autonomous floats, Argo.
He was told that this winter has been mild until a very cold air mass covered the area one week before he visited.</description>

      <description> A farewell party  Sadly, we had to let Ajin Cho and Sanghyun Kim go.
Ajin started working in the industry after the graduation and Sanghyun went to UC Davis as an exchange student. We wish you the best! </description>

      <description>Hajoon Song visited MIT from July 1st to August 24th, 2018, as a visiting professor. During the stay, he contributes to the project of the simulation of the Gulf of Arabia using a very high-resolution numerical ocean model with Professor John Marshall and Dr. MaryamRashed Alshehhi. His role involved the launch of the ocean model, analyze and diagnose the model results, and visualize the simulation. Another project he was involved with was the diagnosing the simulation of Arctic with the interest of the heat transport from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arctic.</description>
