      <description>대기-해양 모델링 연구실에서 대학원생 연구원을 모집합니다. 
저희 연구실에서는 대기-해양 상호작용이 대기와 해양의 순환과 탄소교환에 미치는 영향에 대한 프로젝트를 수행하고 있습니다. 이 프로젝트에서 저희는 위성 및 무인관측값과 고해상도 수치모델을 이용하는 연구를 계획중이며, 함께 연구할 수 있는 대학원 연구원을 모집하고 있습니다.
대기-해양 순환에 대한 이해와 호기심, 그리고 진지한 자세를 가지신 분들은 모두 환영입니다. 소정의 연구비도 지급해 드립니다.
저희 연구실에 대해 궁금한 점이 있으시면 hajsong@yonsei.ac.kr 로 문의해 주시고,
입학에 관한 궁금증이 있으시면 입학안내를 참고해 주시기 바랍니다.</description>

      <description>Hajoon Song visited MIT from February 6th to February 20th, 2019, as a visiting professor. As in last summer, he collaborated with Professor John Marshall and Dr. MaryamRashed Alshehhi to understand the ocean circulation in the area of Arabian Gulf.
Using the state-of-art ocean circulation model, we tried to explain the salinity maximum in the subsurface of Arabian Sea observed in situ measurements and autonomous floats, Argo.
He was told that this winter has been mild until a very cold air mass covered the area one week before he visited.</description>

      <description> A farewell party  Sadly, we had to let Ajin Cho and Sanghyun Kim go.
Ajin started working in the industry after the graduation and Sanghyun went to UC Davis as an exchange student. We wish you the best! </description>

      <description>Hajoon Song visited MIT from July 1st to August 24th, 2018, as a visiting professor. During the stay, he contributes to the project of the simulation of the Gulf of Arabia using a very high-resolution numerical ocean model with Professor John Marshall and Dr. MaryamRashed Alshehhi. His role involved the launch of the ocean model, analyze and diagnose the model results, and visualize the simulation. Another project he was involved with was the diagnosing the simulation of Arctic with the interest of the heat transport from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arctic.</description>
