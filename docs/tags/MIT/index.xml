      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hajoon Song visited MIT again from July 15th to August 20th, 2019, as a visiting professor.&#xA;He continued to collaborate with Professor John Marshall and Dr. MaryamRashed Alshehhi to understand the ocean circulation in the area of Arabian Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(photo from &lt;a&#xA;  class=&#34;gdoc-markdown__link&#34;&#xA;  href=&#34;http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/news_article_image_top_slideshow/public/images/2016/MIT-2016-Campus-Aerial-01_0.jpg?itok=QyJZZZwc&#34;&#xA;&gt;MIT news&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hajoon Song visited MIT from February 6th to February 20th, 2019, as a visiting professor.&#xA;As in last summer, he collaborated with Professor John Marshall and Dr. MaryamRashed Alshehhi to understand the ocean circulation in the area of Arabian Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the state-of-art ocean circulation model, we tried to explain the salinity maximum in the subsurface of Arabian Sea observed in situ measurements and autonomous floats, Argo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was told that this winter has been mild until a very cold air mass covered the area one week before he visited.&#xA;Even though it snowed during his stay, the weather became warm again.&#xA;On the Charles River, there were numerous &amp;ldquo;pancakes&amp;rdquo; of ice, telling that the winter was ready to retreat.&#xA;BUT don&amp;rsquo;t be off guard. You never know when winter revisits until April (from his experience).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Hajoon Song visited MIT from July 1st to August 24th, 2018, as a visiting professor.&#xA;During the stay, he contributes to the project of the simulation of the Gulf of Arabia using a very high-resolution numerical ocean model with Professor John Marshall and Dr. MaryamRashed Alshehhi.&#xA;His role involved the launch of the ocean model, analyze and diagnose the model results, and visualize the simulation.&#xA;Another project he was involved with was the diagnosing the simulation of Arctic with&#xA;the interest of the heat transport from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arctic. This research will use the tool called “layers package”, and his research experience in this played a significant role.</description>
