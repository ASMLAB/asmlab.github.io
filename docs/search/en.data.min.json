Consistent eastward wind results in upwelling of the water from the interior of the ocean, providing a passage for the exchange between the atmosphere and deep ocean. Unlike other major ocean basins, it does not have boundaries so that water circulates all around Antarctica. This wind-driven current is called Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and flows eastward connecting Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. The Southern Ocean plays an important role in earth\u0026rsquo;s climate. It stores up to 40% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) that enters the ocean. The connection between the atmosphere and subsurface ocean makes the Southern Ocean the area where the ocean breathes. The Southern Ocean is also biologically interesting area. The biological activity has a strong seasonal variability (Fig. 1) and is generally limited by light in winter and micronutrient in summer. Although intensive biological activities in the SO (Fig. 1) promote carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake, the overturning circulation and the intensive vertical mixing in winter allow CO2 in the deep ocean to escape to the atmosphere at the same time. The Southern Ocean has high eddy activities. When the upwelling brings dense water to the surface, it makes the ocean high in potential energy and eddies convert it to kinetic energy. My research interest lies on how these eddies modify the air-sea CO2 flux and other oceanic biogeochemical states.\nMeridional Wind on the Antarctic sea ice The meridional wind over the Antarctic sea ice is less certain. We investigate the responses of the Southern Ocean circulation to the meridionl wind. Please refer to this page for this study.\nPatagonian shelf Patagonian shelf, located in the southwest Atlantic ocean, is one of the regions of the biggest CO2 uptake due to the high productivity. I investigate the nutrient sources that support the ecosystem in the Patagonian shelf area using an adjoint sensitivity analysis with passive tracers. This computationally efficient method identifies three major nutrient sources: local area, Chilean coastal area and deep southeast Pacific. It also shows that the wintertime vertical mixing is one of the key processes that deliver nutrients to the Patagonian shelf region as shown in Figure 3. Guided by the adjoint experiments, I also performed a series of forward model with nutrient perturbations at the source regions. The forward biogeochemical integrations support the source water regions for the Patagonian shelf are also the sources of the nutrients. The manuscript that describes this study is under review, and I will provide it when it is published. Check out the story at mitgcm.org\nCalifornia Current System Upwelling source waters Along the California coast, equatorward wind transports water to offshore, creating divergence and upwelling at the coast. In the open ocean, the divergence and upwelling can occur when the wind-driven offshore transport of water increases as we go offshore. The latter mechanism is referred to the Ekman pumping upwelling and depends on the wind field structure. Equatorward wind can have an abrupt change near the coast, but cliamte models cannot resovle a sharp drop-off of the wind. I wanted to investigate how the upwelling source waters change if we can resolve the sharp drop-off of the wind near the coast.\nWhen equatorward wind stress has a gradual change (left panel in Figure 4), wind stress curl is weakly positive over the broad region near the coast, causing weak and shallow upwelling. Hence, the sources for the upwelling are local waters. In constrast, the sharp drop-off of the wind stress creates strong positive curl near the coast (right panel in Figure 4). The coast upwelling become stronger with the Ekman pumping upwelling, and the deep enough to have the poleward undercurrent as a source. Equatorward flow is located nearer to the coast, and it also supplies water to the upwelling. This result has applications for predicting how interannual and decadal changes in wind conditions alter the source and properties of upwelled waters and, consequently, the marine ecosystem in the California Current. Please refer Song et al. (2010) for more details.\n","description":"We are investigating the general ocean circulation in varied scales.\nSouthern Ocean Meridional Wind on the Antarctic sea ice Patagonian shelf California Current System Upwelling source waters Southern Ocean The Southern Ocean is unique.

Recent increases in fire acitivities, marked by record-breaking fire events worldwide, raises concerns about a potential further surge in atmospheric CO2 levels. To address these uncertainties in future CO2 concentration, this study leverages climate model simulations to estimates future fire carbon emissions associated with enhanced fire weather. Furthermore, we assess whether/how effectively carbon reductions through neagative emissions could mitigate the heightened fire risk.\nKey points Methods Simulation Fire Weather Index Results How much CO2 will be emitted from increased fires? Even if we return the GHG level\u0026hellip; Implications Publication Key points In concentration-driven simulations, where wildfire emissions are often overlooked, the level of warming in future climates may have been underestimated. Once-elevated fire risk is not alleviated immediately by carbon removal due to the inertia of the climate system. Proper prevention and management plans are needed in order to successfully deliver the designed mitigation pathways. Methods Simulation We used CESM1.2 to simulate the climate status under\nDoubled CO2 (year 2070), and Reversed CO2 (year 2210). Fire Weather Index Fire weather index (FWI; Van Wagner, 1987) measures the degree of fire risk in terms of meteological conditions. It requires four daily variables: local noon-time near-surface temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and 24-hour precipitation.\nThough simple, FWI can capture the actual fire activity (burned area, emission, etc.), with its high value significantly correlated with high fire emissions in wide areas over the globe. In other words, fire carbon emissions can be roughly estimated using weather variables.\nResults graph LR; A((\"**Climate Change**\")) B((\"**Fire Weather**\")) C((\"**Fire Activity**\")) D((\"**Carbon Emissions**\")) A --15% increaseby doubling CO2--\u003e B B --\u003e C C --53% potential increaseby doubling CO2--\u003e D D --\u003e A style A fill:#d77,stroke:white,stroke-width:1px,color:#fff style B fill:#d77,stroke:white,stroke-width:1px,color:#fff style C fill:#d77,stroke:white,stroke-width:1px,color:#fff style D fill:#d77,stroke:white,stroke-width:1px,color:#fff How much CO2 will be emitted from increased fires? Our estimate suggests that fire danger will increase by approximately 15% under doubled greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration. This, however, corresponds to about 53% more fire emissions, since fire danger increases more in regions where fire activity is highly sensitive to weather conditions.\nEven if we return the GHG level\u0026hellip; The heightened fire risk is projected to persist for a while (though with regional differences), and will not be immediately reversed to its previous level. Such prolonged high fire activity could continue to act as an additional source of GHG into the atmosphere.\nImplications Without proper management practices, increased fires could significantly disrupt the intended emission pathways, both globally and locally.\nFor instance, in the countries shown on the left, additional fire emissions inferred from prolonged fire risks could amount to 13-54% of their current fire emissions; i.e., more attention should be paid to fire management in controlling their national GHG inventories.\nShown on the right are countries where GHG reduction could lead to a substantial decrease in fire-related emissions; The total fire carbon reduction effect in these 10 countries (1.35 Pg/yr) is comparable to that of all other countries combined (1.44 Pg/yr). These countries can thus be regarded as key regions for global co-benefits in accelerating the reduction of GHG levels.\nPublication Kim, H.-J. and J.-S. Kim, S.-I. An, J. Shin, J.-H. Oh, and J.-S.

The air-sea CO2 exchange depends on the difference in partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) between air and ocean. Since atmospheric pCO2 is nearly uniform and well-known, oceanic pCO2 is a key factor for the air-sea CO2 exchange. In contrast to CFC-11, not only physical but also biogeochemical states of the ocean influence pCO2, which requires more comprehensive analysis. In summer, oceanic pCO2 is lower in anticyclones while cyclonic eddies have higher oceanic pCO2. Interestingly, this relationship is flipped in winter and anticyclones/cyclones have higher/lower pCO2. The seasonality of the relationship between eddies and pCO2 is resulted from the time-varying balance between two opposing thermal and DIC effects. Please refer to our paper, Song et al. (2016), for more details.\nAir-Sea CFC-11 exchange A chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11) is an anthropogenic gas that was first introduced to the atmosphere in 1940s. CFC-11 is inert in the ocean with known atmospheric source, so it is useful to evaluate the ocean ventilation rate in ocean circulation models. Using an eddy-resolving model, we find that warm anticyclones have lower CFC-11 concentration at the surface, leading to more uptake of CFC-11 by the ocean (Fig. 2(e)). In cold cyclones, in contrast, the anomaly of CFC-11 concentration is positive, suggesting that cyclones take up less CFC-11 (Fig. 2(f)). The opposite sign of CFC-11 anomaly is attributed to the anomalous vertical mixing. Eddy centric analysis reveals more intense vertical mixing in anticyclones, but reduced mixing in cyclones (Fig. 2(a,b)). With strong vertical mixing, the surface ocean, usually saturated with CFC-11, is well mixed with low CFC-11 water at the subsurface, resulting in reduction of CFC-11 concentration at the surface and more uptaking of CFC-11. The opposite occurs in cyclones: less vertical mixing leads to higher CFC-11 concentration at the surface and less uptake. The anomalies in anticyclones and cyclones do not completely cancel out, leaving a net positive effect of CFC-11 uptake by mesoscale eddies. Please refer to Song et al. (2015) for more details.\nAir-Sea coupled simulation Air-sea coupling frequencies in the coupled model The near-inertial waves (NIWs) are critical in the ocean mixing near the surface as they enhance the vertical shear of the ocean flow. In our study, we demonstrate that excluding the NIWs indeed decreases the vertical mixing. We also show that excluding NIWs changed the CO2 exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean.\nDumping of heat by tropical cyclones We investigate how much of heat is provided by tropical cyclones and where this heat goes under the surface using a coupled atmosphere-ocean model.\n","description":"We are investigating air-sea couplings to understand the climate system in both large- and meso-scale processes.

Miller, Dynamic and Thermodynamic coupling between the Atmosphere and Ocean near the Kuroshio Current and Extension System, Ocean Modelling, accepted ↕ Abstract Relative wind (RW; wind relative to surface currents) has been shown to play a crucial role in air-sea interactions, influencing both atmospheric and oceanic dynamics. While the RW effects through momentum flux are well-documented, those through turbulent heat fluxes remain unknown.In this study, we investigate two distinct surface current feedbacks \u0026ndash; those associated with the momentum flux and turbulent heat fluxes \u0026ndash; by modifying respective bulk formulations in the regional ocean-atmosphere coupled system, and analyze both immediate and seasonal changes in the boundary layers. Our results show that strong ocean currents in the Kuroshio Current and Extension significantly impact surface coupling, with responses generally contingent on the wind-current angle: an increase (decrease) in air-sea momentum and turbulent heat fluxes occurs when the low-level wind and surface currents are aligned (opposed). The instantaneous responses to surface currents include changes in low- level wind, surface current speed, and humidity, which are consistent with anticipated changes for a given wind-current angle based on the bulk formulations. While the wind- current angle is still an important factor, it does not adequately capture the seasonal responses. On the seasonal timescale, both surface current feedbacks can alter the path of the Kuroshio Extension and mesoscale activities, resulting in different background states that affect air-sea momentum and turbulent heat exchanges. Our results suggest that the energetic current system, such as the Kuroshio Current and Extension, can be significantly influenced by surface current coupling through both momentum and turbulent heat fluxes.\nLee, C., H. Song, Y. Choi, A. Cho and J. Marshall, Observed multi-decadal increase in the surface ocean\u0026rsquo;s thermal inertia, Nature Climate Change, accepted ↕ Abstract The ocean surface layer is crucial in Earth\u0026rsquo;s climate, absorbing excess atmospheric heat, thereby regulating global temperatures. Here, using daily sea surface temperature (SST) global data, we document a notable increase in the persistence of SST anomalies across the global ocean since 1982. This trend is also evident in frequency space, showing decreased variance of SST on timescales shorter than a month but a slight increase on longer timescales. A simple stochastic model attributes this prolonged memory to three key factors: deepening of the surface mixed layer, weakening of the oceanic forcing, and reduced damping rates. The first two factors decrease the variance on shorter timescales, while the third increases it on longer timescales. Our findings have great relevance to the observed increase in the duration of marine heatwaves and associated heightened thermal threats to marine organisms. Our study also suggests that the ocean\u0026rsquo;s ability to sequester heat is weakening.\nSong, H. and Y. Choi, E.W. Doddridge and J. Marshall, The Responses of Antarctic sea ice and overturning cells to meridional wind forcing, Journal of Climate, accepted ↕ Abstract Meridional winds over the seasonal ice zone of the Antarctic have undergone changes and likely contributed to sea ice extent variability in recent decades. In this study, using observations and an eddy-resolving channel model of the Antarctic seasonal ice zone, we investigate the influence of meridional wind changes on the sea ice distribution, and document how the underlying ocean might change. We find that southerly wind anomalies in austral winter lead to an increase in sea ice extent by encouraging equatorward sea ice drift. This results in more leads and polynyas, ice production and buoyancy loss near the coastal region and freshening out in the open ocean near the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. In contrast, summertime southerly wind anomalies reduce sea ice extent due to warming anomalies near the sea ice edge. This is a consequence of enhanced meridional overturning circulation (MOC) triggered by enhanced buoyancy loss through surface heat flux and brine rejection, which brings relatively warm water towards the summertime sea ice edge. A water-mass transformation analysis reveals the increased deep water formation caused by brine rejection and heat loss in leads and polynyas. Changes in sea ice extent and MOC behave in the opposite way when the sign of the wind anomaly is switched from southerly to northerly. Our study shows that meridional wind anomalies can modify not only the sea ice distribution, extent of polynyas and air-sea buoyancy fluxes, but also the ocean\u0026rsquo;s MOC and bottom water properties.\nNoh, Y., H.J. Seunu, H. Song and Y. Choi, Mixing of top-down and bottom-up diffusing reactive tracers within the ocean mixed layer and its application to autumn phytoplankton blooms. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, 129, e2024JC021757. https://doi.org/10.1029/2024JC021757 ↕ Abstract The mixing of reactive tracers within the ocean mixed layer, phytoplankton transported downwards from the sea surface and nutrients transported upwards from the mixed layer depth, is investigated using large eddy simulation coupled to a Lagrangian plankton model. The study focuses on how vertical and horizontal heterogeneity in tracer distributions is generated and how it influences an autumn phytoplankton bloom. The vertical gradient appears in the profiles of horizontal mean phytoplankton and nutrient concentrations, P and N, and it reduces phytoplankton production by photosynthesis compared to the cases with uniform distributions. The reduction ratio decreases as the mixed-layer mean N increases, but it remains relatively insensitive to other conditions such as mixed layer depth, surface forcing, stratification below the mixed layer, and the initial N. Phytoplankton and nutrient concentrations show a negative correlation in the horizontal plane, which becomes stronger with increasing depth. Its contribution to plankton production by photosynthesis is negligible, however, because the correlation is weak near the sea surface and the reaction time scale is much longer than the turbulent mixing time scale. It is also found that the vertical gradients of P and N are smaller, and the negative correlation is stronger in the convective mixed layer than in the shear-driven mixed layer. A simple box plankton model, which takes into account the mixing process of tracers, is proposed and used to investigate how mixing affects the prediction of an autumn phytoplankton bloom.\nKim, H.-J. and J.-S.

Nature Communications 15 11010. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54339-2 ↕ Abstract Enhanced fire-prone weather under greenhouse gas warming can significantly affect local and global carbon budgets from increased fire occurrence, influencing carbon-climate feedbacks. However, the extent to which changes in fire-prone weather and associated carbon emissions can be mitigated by negative emissions remains uncertain. Here, we analyze fire weather responses in CO2 removal climate model experiments and estimate their potential carbon emissions based on an observational relationship between fire weather and fire-induced CO2 emissions. The results highlight that enhanced fire danger under global warming cannot be restored instantaneously by CO2 reduction, mainly due to atmospheric dryness maintained by climatic inertia. The exacerbated fire danger is projected to contribute to extra CO2 emissions in 68% of global regions due to the hysteresis of climate responses to CO2 levels. These findings highlight that even under global cooling from negative emissions, increased fire activity may reinforce the fire-carbon-climate feedback loop and result in further socio-economic damage.\nAn, S.-I., Moon, J.-Y., Dijkstra, H.

Communications Earth \u0026amp; Environment, 5(1), 490. https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01670-7 ↕ Abstract The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is an important component of the climate system because of its role in the heat transport. Its strength is sensitive to the surface density but mechanisms of the effect of Southern Ocean freshwater anomalies are relatively unknown. Here, we investigate the impact of Antarctic ice sheet meltwater on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation using an earth system model of intermediate complexity. The meltwater over the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean is transported to the east and, after passing the Drake Passage, travels northward reaching the North Atlantic. Furthermore, Southern Ocean cooling induces a northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, leading to more precipitation in the tropical Atlantic. Consequently, the reduced salinity weakens the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Additional experiments, in which the duration period of freshwater hosing was varied while keeping its total amount constant, indicate that the amplitude and the duration of the meltwater play crucial roles in determining the degree of reduction in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.\nOh, S.-Y., Yeh, S.-W., Jeong, Y.-C., Song, H., \u0026amp; Lee, M.-H.

International Journal of Climatology, 1–13. https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.8488 ↕ Abstract The k-means clustering of reanalysis datasets is used to classify the intrinsic atmospheric circulation in Asia based on the daily geopotential height of 500 hPa during the boreal summer (June, July and August) for 1958–2020. Among the total clusters of atmospheric circulation patterns in Asia, two distinct clusters of atmospheric circulation are characterized by a significant increasing trend in occurrence. They correspond to different zonal wave numbers (1–2 vs. 3–4) of atmospheric circulation in the mid-to-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, and their associated sea surface temperature structures are not the same in the tropical Pacific and the North Atlantic. Further analysis indicates that two clusters of atmospheric circulation alter the amount of summer monsoon precipitation in East Asia, and an increasing amount of precipitation in southern China in recent decades could be explained by the combined effect of an increasing trend in the frequency of occurrence of two clusters of atmospheric circulation. Finally, a long-term simulation of the Community Earth System Model version 2 suggests that anthropogenic forcing may be responsible for the increasing trend of occurrence of the two atmospheric circulations in Asia.\nSalim, M., Subeesh M P, J.

Commun., 6, 071006. https://doi.org/10.1088/2515-7620/ad578c ↕ Abstract We investigate the influence of tides on the exchange of water between the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman through the Strait of Hormuz using a high-resolution numerical model. Two numerical simulations are contrasted, one with and one without tidal forcing. We find that tides suppress exchange through the Strait, by ∼20% in the annual mean, being largest in the summer (∼30%) and diminishing in the winter (∼13%). Tides enhance the parameterised shear-driven vertical mixing inside the Gulf and Strait, mixing warm, relatively fresh surface waters downward thus reducing the density of bottom waters flowing outwards. This reduces the lateral difference of density between Gulf and Sea of Oman and hence the exchange through the Strait. Maximum reductions occur in summer when both the vertical stratification and mixing is the largest.\nKim, D., H. Song, H.-Y. Chun, C. Yoo, M.-J. Kang and H.-K.

Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 129, e2023JD039678. https://doi.org/10.1029/2023JD039678 ↕ Abstract The tropical climate variabilities, such as Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), are accompanied by changes in the tropical deep convection which can influence the atmospheric circulation in the Southern Hemisphere (SH). To investigate each role of IOD and ENSO in the September-November (SON) circulation, we examine teleconnection patterns associated with IOD and ENSO events using the ERA5 monthly averaged data from 1979 to 2020. Our approach is to calculate the power spectral density (PSD) of the sea level pressure (SLP) and meridional wind and geopotential height at 300 hPa that are decomposed by zonal wave numbers (ZWNs), and to compute their correlations with IOD and ENSO at each latitudinal band. The main results are that IOD (ENSO) is negatively (positively) correlated with PSDs of ZWN2 and ZWN3 (ZWN1) at 300 hPa in the SH middle latitudes. Considering the Rossby wave train, IOD (ENSO) considerably affects the variability of the ZWN3 (ZWN1) pattern, which influences the meridional exchange of momentum. Additionally, the relationship between IOD and ZWN3 has become tighter in recent years, which is not seen in that with ENSO. The IOD and ENSO events also modify the SLP patterns and meridional surface winds, modulating the sea ice extent in the Southern Ocean. During the highly positive 2019 IOD event, the variability of the middle latitudes atmospheric circulation was considerably larger than climatology, suggesting a higher chance of more extreme weather patterns associated with more frequent intense IOD events in the warming climate.\nYun, J., K.-J. Ha and S.-S. Lee (2024): Impact of greenhouse warming on mesoscale eddy characteristics in high-resolution climate simulations. Environmental Research Letters, 19(1), 014078. https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad114b ↕ Abstract Mesoscale eddies are prevalent throughout the global ocean and have significant implications on the exchange of heat, salt, volume, and biogeochemical properties. These small-scale features can potentially influence regional and global climate systems. However, the effects of climate change on ocean eddies remain uncertain due to limited long-term observational data. To address this knowledge gap, our study focuses on examining the impact of greenhouse warming on surface mesoscale eddy characteristics, utilizing a high-resolution climate simulation project. Our model experiments provided valuable insights into the potential effects of greenhouse warming on mesoscale eddies, suggesting that mesoscale eddies will likely become more frequent under greenhouse warming conditions and exhibit larger amplitudes and radii, especially in regions characterized by strong ocean currents such as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and western boundary currents. However, a distinctive pattern emerged in the Gulf Stream, with increases in eddy occurrence and radius and significant decreases in eddy amplitude. This phenomenon can be attributed to the relationship between eddy lifespans and their properties. Specifically, in the Kuroshio Current, the amplitude of eddies increased due to the increased occurrence of long-lived eddies. In contrast, in the Gulf Stream, the amplitude of eddies decreased significantly due to the decreased occurrence of long-lived eddies. This distinction arises from the fact that long-lived eddies can accumulate more energy than shorter-lived eddies throughout their lifetime. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of mesoscale eddies in a warming world.\nNoh, K.M., J.H. Oh, H.G. Lim, H.

Earth\u0026rsquo;s Future, 12(1), e2023EF003709. https://doi.org/10.1029/2023EF003709 ↕ Abstract Recent changes in the Arctic sea-ice are strongly influenced by the recent increase in heat transport from vigorous Atlantic inflows, so-called Atlantification. This Atlantification can induce physical and ecological changes near the Atlantic gateway. Here, we used the observational data sets and 26 Earth system models to estimate Atlantic water intrusion, and firstly suggest the impact of Atlantification on marine productivity in the Barents Sea in a warming climate, especially on boreal spring. In a warming climate, the heat transport across the Barents Sea Opening (BSO) is projected to be enhanced (45.5 ± 34.9 TW) by the end of the 21st century compared to the present climate. This poleward intrusion of the Atlantic water is likely to increase productivity with the largest increase in spring (70%). In a warming climate, the productivity is enhanced by Atlantification-induced changes in physical states—ocean temperature, circulations, stratification, and sea-ice. Based on inter-model analyses, we estimated that the Atlantification can explain approximately 26% of the productivity changes in the Barents Sea. Thus, Atlantification is critical for future changes in biological productivity and physical states over the Arctic Ocean.\nTak Y.-J., Y. K. Cho, H. Song, S. W. Chae and Y. Y. Kim (2023): Spatial Similarity between the Changjiang Diluted Water and Marine Heatwaves in the East China Sea during Summer. The Sea Journal of the Korean Society of Oceanography, 28(4), 121-132. doi:10.7850/jkso.2023.28.4.121 ↕ Abstract Marine heatwaves (MHWs), referring to anomalously high sea surface temperatures, have drawn significant attention from marine scientists due to their broad impacts on the surface marine ecosystem, fisheries, weather patterns, and various human activities. In this study, we examined the impact of the distribution of Changjiang diluted water (CDW), a significant factor causing oceanic property changes in the East China Sea (ECS) during the summer, on MHWs. The surface salinity distribution in the ECS indicates that from June to August, the eastern extension of the CDW influences areas as far as Jeju Island and the Korea Strait. In September, however, the CDW tends to reside in the Changjiang estuary. Through the Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis of the cumulative intensity of MHWs during the summer, we extracted the loading vector of the first mode and its principal component time series to conduct a correlation analysis with the distribution of the CDW. The results revealed a strong negative spatial correlation between areas of the CDW and regions with high cumulative intensity of MHWs, indicating that the reinforcement of stratification due to low-salinity water can increase the intensity and duration of MHWs. This study suggests that the CDW may still influence the spatial distribution of MHWs in the region, highlighting the importance of oceanic environmental factors in the occurrence of MHWs in the waters surrounding the Korean Peninsula.\nKim H.-J., An S.-I., Park J.-H., Sung M.-K., Kim D., Choi Y., Kim J.-S.

In this study, we used 42 coupled atmosphere–ocean global climate models to analyze low-frequency variability of the AMOC driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Our results showed that the influence of the simulated NAO on the AMOC differs significantly between the models. We showed that the large intermodel diversity originates from the diverse oceanic mean state, especially over the subpolar North Atlantic (SPNA), where deep water formation of the AMOC occurs. For some models, the climatological sea ice extent covers a wide area of the SPNA and restrains efficient air–sea interactions, making the AMOC less sensitive to the NAO. In the models without the sea-ice-covered SPNA, the upper-ocean mean stratification critically affects the relationship between the NAO and AMOC by regulating the AMOC sensitivity to surface buoyancy forcing. Our results pinpoint the oceanic mean state as an aspect of climate model simulations that must be improved for an accurate understanding of the AMOC.\nTak, Y-J, H. Song, Y. Noh, Choi, Y. (2023): Physical and biogeochemical responses in the Southern Ocean to a simple parameterization of Langmuir circulation. Ocean Modelling, 181, 102152, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2022.102152 ↕ Abstract Langmuir circulation (LC) plays an important role in deepening the mixed layer, especially when the ocean is weakly stratified. LC parameterization has been known to improve the accuracy of the mixed-layer depth, sea surface temperature, and ocean ventilation in the Southern Ocean. However, changes in ocean dynamics and biogeochemical processes owing to LC mixing have rarely been investigated. In this study, we implemented LC parameterization to a physical–biogeochemical coupled model and examined the changes in water properties and circulation and their effects on biogeochemical processes in the Southern Ocean. The LC effect enhances the turbulent mixing length scale and turbulent kinetic energy, especially in the subantarctic region, resulting in the deepening of the mixed layer. Increased vertical mixing causes deeper warm and saline water to reach the surface layer and weakens the surface meridional velocity by transferring momentum deeper. The weakening of the meridional velocity decreases equatorward freshwater transport, causing the surface water to become saltier and denser north of 50°S adjacent to the formation site of Subantarctic Mode Water, which enhances ocean ventilation eventually. Additionally, the weak equatorward velocity drives the retreat of sea-ice south of 60°S, leading to cooler and fresher water in the southern region of 60°S. Changes in the sea-ice distribution, mixed-layer depth, and dissolved inorganic carbon distribution alter the air-sea CO2 exchange, suggesting that the LC parameterization in the model can ameliorate 10% of the air-sea CO2 exchange. The LC effects on biogeochemical tracers, such as iron (Fe) and dissolved inorganic carbon, are mainly determined by changes in ocean circulation, and the modest improvement in primary productivity is mainly attributed to the changes in the Fe distribution in the high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll region, where Fe availability limits primary production. Although the direct LC effects occur near the surface, the altered meridional circulation spreads the effects to a deeper layer and improves the overall representation of physical, biogeochemical tracers and air-sea CO2 exchange in the Southern Ocean, suggesting that a simple LC parameterization can improve the ocean model.\nChoi, Y., Y.

Oceanic Technol., 39(10), 1483-1498, https://doi.org/10.1175/JTECH-D-21-0157.1 ↕ Abstract The ocean mixed layer model (OMLM) is improved using the large eddy simulation (LES) and the inverse estimation method. A comparison of OMLM (Noh model) and LES results reveals that underestimation of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) flux in the OMLM causes a negative bias of the mixed layer depth (MLD) during convection, when the wind stress is weak or the latitude is high. It is further found that the entrainment layer thickness is underestimated. The effects of alternative approaches of parameterizations in the OMLM, such as nonlocal mixing, length scales, Prandtl number, and TKE flux, are examined with an aim to reduce the bias. Simultaneous optimizations of empirical constants in the various versions of Noh model with different parameterization options are then carried out via an iterative Green’s function approach with LES data as constraining data. An improved OMLM is obtained, which reflects various new features, including the enhanced TKE flux, and the new model is found to improve the performance in all cases, namely, wind-mixing, surface heating, and surface cooling cases. The effect of the OMLM grid resolution on the optimal empirical constants is also investigated.\nTak, Y-J., H. Song and J-Y. Park (2022): IWintertime marine extreme temperature events modulate phytoplankton blooms in the North Pacific through subtropical mode water. Environmental Research Letters, 17(9), 094040, https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac8e8a ↕ Abstract Marine extreme temperature events (METs), including marine heatwaves (MHWs) and cold spells, have recently gained much attention owing to their vital influence on the marine ecosystem and social economy. Since METs can alter the upper ocean stratification and wintertime convective mixing in the northwestern North Pacific subtropical gyre (NPSG), their activities may modulate phytoplankton blooms by regulating entrainment of the subtropical mode water (STMW) with high NO. Furthermore, because STMW formed in the previous winter reemerges east of its formation site in the following winter, the METs activities imprinted in STMW affect phytoplankton blooms remote from its formation site. Here, we examined the relationship between the MET activities, STMW volume, and phytoplankton blooms using satellite observations and a data-assimilative coupled physical-biogeochemical model dataset. MET activities appearing in the STMW formation region during winter regulate the formation of STMW and the supply of NO from the subsurface, with the latter controlling the spring/autumn blooms in that region under NO-limited conditions. Subsequently, this water mass is transported eastward in the subsurface within the northern flank of the NPSG before reemerging east of the STMW formation site the following spring. This process results in a negative lag-correlation between MET activities and surface chlorophyll in the reemergence region; for example, MHWs in winter at the STMW formation site tend to lower the surface chlorophyll concentration one year later in the reemergence region. Our study suggests that the oceanic processes allow one year of predictability of the marine ecosystems by monitoring METs in the STMW formation site.\nCho, A., Song, H., Tak, Y-J., Yeh, S-W., An, S-I., Lee, S-M., Ji, H-S. and Hyun, Y-K. (2022): Atmosphere-driven cold SST biases over the western North Pacific in the GloSea5 seasonal forecast system. Climate Dynamics, 59, 2571-2584, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-022-06228-x ↕ Abstract The predictability of the sea surface temperature (SST) in seasonal forecast systems is crucial for accurate seasonal predictions. In this study, we evaluated the prediction of SST in the Global Seasonal forecast system version 5 (GloSea5) hindcast, particularly focusing on the western North Pacific (WNP), where the SST can modify atmospheric convection and the East Asian weather. GloSea5 has a cold SST bias in the WNP that grows over at least 7 months. The bias originates from the surface net heat flux. At the beginning of model integration, the ocean receives excessive heat from the atmosphere because of the predominant positive bias in the downward shortwave radiation (SW), which rapidly decreased within a few days as cloud cover builds. Then, the negative bias in the latent heat (LH) flux increases over time and induces a negative bias in the surface net heat flux. Although the magnitude of the negative bias in LH flux gradually decreases, it remains the most significant contributor to the negative bias in the net heat flux bias for more than 250 days. Uncoupled ocean model experiments showed that the ocean model is unlikely to be the primary source of the SST bias.\nKwak, K., Song, H., Marshall, J., Seo, H. and McGillicuddy, D. J.

Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, 126, e2021JC017884, https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JC017884 ↕ Abstract The Southern Ocean, an important region for the uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), features strong surface currents due to substantial mesoscale meanders and eddies. These features interact with the wind and modify the momentum transfer from the atmosphere to the ocean. Although such interactions are known to reduce momentum transfer, their impact on air-sea carbon exchange remains unclear. Using a 1/20° physical-biogeochemical coupled ocean model, we examined the impact of the current-wind interaction on the surface carbon concentration and the air-sea carbon exchange in the Southern Ocean. The current-wind interaction decreased winter partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) at the ocean surface mainly south of the northern subantarctic front. It also reduced pCO2 in summer, indicating enhanced uptake, but not to the same extent as the winter loss. Consequently, the net outgassing of CO2 was found to be reduced by approximately 17% when including current-wind interaction. These changes stem from the combined effect of vertical mixing and Ekman divergence. A budget analysis of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) revealed that a weakening of vertical mixing by current-wind interaction reduces the carbon supply from below, and particularly so in winter. The weaker wind stress additionally lowers the subsurface DIC concentration in summer, which can affect the vertical diffusive flux of carbon in winter. Our study suggests that ignoring current-wind interactions in the Southern Ocean can overestimate winter CO2 outgassing.\nAl-Shehhi, M.R., H. Song, J.R. Scott and J.

Journal of Physical Oceanography, 51(11), 3513-3527, https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-20-0249.1 ↕ Abstract We diagnose the ocean’s residual overturning circulation of the Arabian Gulf in a high-resolution model and interpret it in terms of water-mass transformation processes mediated by air–sea buoyancy fluxes and interior mixing. We attempt to rationalize the complex three-dimensional flow in terms of the superposition of a zonal (roughly along axis) and meridional (transverse) overturning pattern. Rates of overturning and the seasonal cycle of air–sea fluxes sustaining them are quantified and ranked in order of importance. Air–sea fluxes dominate the budget so that, at zero order, the magnitude and sense of the overturning circulation can be inferred from air–sea fluxes, with interior mixing playing a lesser role. We find that wintertime latent heat fluxes dominate the water-mass transformation rate in the interior waters of the Gulf leading to a diapycnal volume flux directed toward higher densities. In the zonal overturning cell, fluid is drawn in from the Sea of Oman through the Strait of Hormuz, transformed, and exits the Strait near the southern and bottom boundaries. Along the southern margin of the Gulf, evaporation plays an important role in the meridional overturning pattern inducing sinking there.\nSeo, H., H. Song, L.W. O\u0026rsquo;Neill, M.R.

Miller, Dynamic and Thermodynamic coupling between the Atmosphere and Ocean near the Kuroshio Current and Extension System, Ocean Modelling, accepted ↕ Abstract Relative wind (RW; wind relative to surface currents) has been shown to play a crucial role in air-sea interactions, influencing both atmospheric and oceanic dynamics. While the RW effects through momentum flux are well-documented, those through turbulent heat fluxes remain unknown.In this study, we investigate two distinct surface current feedbacks \u0026ndash; those associated with the momentum flux and turbulent heat fluxes \u0026ndash; by modifying respective bulk formulations in the regional ocean-atmosphere coupled system, and analyze both immediate and seasonal changes in the boundary layers. Our results show that strong ocean currents in the Kuroshio Current and Extension significantly impact surface coupling, with responses generally contingent on the wind-current angle: an increase (decrease) in air-sea momentum and turbulent heat fluxes occurs when the low-level wind and surface currents are aligned (opposed). The instantaneous responses to surface currents include changes in low- level wind, surface current speed, and humidity, which are consistent with anticipated changes for a given wind-current angle based on the bulk formulations. While the wind- current angle is still an important factor, it does not adequately capture the seasonal responses. On the seasonal timescale, both surface current feedbacks can alter the path of the Kuroshio Extension and mesoscale activities, resulting in different background states that affect air-sea momentum and turbulent heat exchanges. Our results suggest that the energetic current system, such as the Kuroshio Current and Extension, can be significantly influenced by surface current coupling through both momentum and turbulent heat fluxes.\n"},{"id":24,"href":"/group/jieunshin/","title":"Jieun Shin","parent":"People in ASML","content":" Education B.S.

Fits were executed using the Regional Ocean Modeling System four-dimensional variational assimilation platform along with adjoint model runs using a passive tracer to deduce source waters for the areas of interest. Analysis using the data-assimilation model runs reveals that unusually strong equatorward wind-forcing drives offshore transport during the La Niña conditions, which extends the spawning habitat for sardine further offshore. A statistical model of sardine spawning habitat shows better habitat quality during the El Niño conditions, which is associated with higher egg densities and corresponded to higher daily egg production. Concentration of eggs is also increased by convergence of water. The results of the source waters analysis using the adjoint data assimilation model support the idea that offshore transport extends the spawning habitat, and show that higher levels of nutrient are brought into the spawning habitat with high concentration of sardine eggs.\nMonthly averaged SST shows colder SST under the La Niña state (Figure 5). Since the offshore transport is stronger in La Niña years, upwelled water can be transported further offshore, resulting in gradual cross-shore SST changes. In contrast, the SST in El Niño years shows a pattern parallel to the coastline, which can be interpreted as an evidence of weaker offshore transport. Please refer Song et al. (2012) for more details.\n","description":" Physical-biogeochemical coupled data assimilation Application of state estimation Pacific Sardine spawning habitat Physical-biogeochemical coupled data assimilation Application of state estimation Pacific Sardine spawning habitat Following is the abstract of \u0026ldquo;Application of a data-assimilation model to variability of Pacific sardine spawning and survivor habitats with ENSO in the California Current System\u0026rdquo; in Journal of Geophysical Research, 2012:\nThe Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) showed significant differences in spawning habitat area, spawning habitat quality and availability of survivor habitat as the Pacific Ocean went through the La Niña state in April 2002 to a weak El Niño in April 2003.

Thus the amount of chlorophyll plays an important role in air-sea CO2 flux. The growth of phytoplankton depends on mainly two factors, light, and nutrient (iron in the Southern Ocean) which phytoplankton takes up as its food. The light provided to phytoplankton is abundant in summer, deficient in winter. Besides that, the light for phytoplankton also depends on the vertical mixing of the ocean. Think of the cinnamon on the top of a cappuccino. If there's stirring motion by a straw, cinnamon spreads vertically and the concentration of cinnamon on the top of the cappuccino decreases. Similarly, vertical mixing of the ocean affects the vertical distribution of phytoplankton and the amount of light they experience. Satellites show that there are full of coherent patterns of anomalously high and low sea level in the ocean with a scale of tens or hundreds of kilometers. They are called mesoscale eddies. The features with higher sea level are called anticyclones while those with lower sea level called cyclones. The observations reveal that they are different in the surface vertical mixing: anticyclones are characterized by deeper vertical mixing but cyclones by shallower vertical mixing. If the mixed layer is deeper, it can enrich nutrient (iron) concentration near the surface. Phytoplankton lives near the surface to secure the sunlight and consumes iron. This leads to the concentration of iron lower near the surface but higher in deeper water. Thus stronger vertical mix can enrich the iron concentration near the surface. At the same time it may reduce the amount of light for phytoplankton as they are brought down to deeper depth where the light level approaches to zero. Phytoplankton needs both light and iron. In summer, light is abundant and the background vertical mixing is not very intense. So even though there's strong vertical mixing, it doesn't have a great impact on the amount of light near the surface. Iron concentration near surface plays the important role instead. Stronger mixing will provide more iron to the surface, hence the concentration of chlorophyll can go up along with the intensity of vertical mixing. In winter, however, due to stronger vertical mixing, the concentration of iron near the surface is quite high, attributing relatively small impact to the concentration of chlorophyll, while the light is almost always scarce. Thus the amount of light near the surface is more important to phytoplankton. Stronger vertical mixing will reduce the light exposure for phytoplankton resulting to the reduction of chlorophyll concentration. These relationship is expressed as a positive correlation between the anomalies of sea level and chlorophyll in summer but a negative correlation in winter in the Southern Ocean. The influence of vertical mixing associated with mesoscale eddies may have direct impact on other biogeochemical fields such as carbon and the exchange of CO2 between air and sea.
